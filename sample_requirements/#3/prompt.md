We need to implement a performance caching layer for athlete searches that automatically invalidates and refreshes when new athlete data is scraped. The cache should support fuzzy matching for misspelled names, maintain a ranked relevance score based on recent performance data, and gracefully degrade if the database is temporarily unavailable. Additionally, implement metrics tracking to identify frequently searched athletes and use that data to pre-warm the cache during off-peak hours. The solution should work seamlessly across both the API and UI without significant changes to existing code.
